## The Rules of the Game

- In this game there is a Player (Cat Girl) and several Enemies (Bugs).
- The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
- The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies.
- Use the arrow keys to move the player left, right, up and down.
- Once the player reaches the water 3 times, the **game is won**.
- The player can only occupy a water space once.
- The player starts the game with 5 hearts (lives) shown in the score panel.
- If the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a heart and moves back to the start square.
- If the player loses all 5 hearts the **game is over**.
